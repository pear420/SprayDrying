# SprayDrying
This repository contains the supporting information for our project of Chemical Plants II, in which we proposed three different ways to model a Spray drying unit:
The scripts for the PFR and CSTR models can be found in the "Visual Studio Sources" Directory while the SIMULINK implementations, together with the MATLAB scripts for the FOPDT model can be found in the "FOPDT" directory.
